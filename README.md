Dataset
AgingAOE-Net requires multi-omics data in a structured format (e.g., CSV or TSV). The repository references datasets available on Zenodo.

Download data:

Download the datasets from Zenodo and place them in the data/ directory.
Follow the structure outlined in data/sample_data/ for custom datasets.


Preprocessing:Use the provided preprocessing script to format the data:
python data/preprocess.py --input data/raw --output data/processed



Usage
The repository provides scripts for preprocessing, training, evaluation, and inference. Below are the main workflows.
Preprocessing
Prepare raw omics data for model input:
python data/preprocess.py --input data/raw --output data/processed


--input: Path to raw data directory
--output: Path to save processed data

Training
Train the AgingAOE-Net model:
python train.py --data_dir data/processed --output_dir outputs/ --epochs 50 --batch_size 32 --lr 0.001

Key arguments:

--data_dir: Path to processed data
--output_dir: Directory for model checkpoints and logs
--epochs: Number of training epochs (default: 50)
--batch_size: Batch size (default: 32)
--lr: Learning rate (default: 0.001)

Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model:
python evaluate.py --model_path outputs/model.pth --data_dir data/processed


--model_path: Path to trained model checkpoint
--data_dir: Path to processed data

Metrics (e.g., MSE, accuracy, AUC) are reported based on the task.
Inference
Perform predictions using a pre-trained model:
python infer.py --model_path outputs/model.pth --input data/processed/sample.csv


--model_path: Path to trained model
--input: Path to input data file

Model Architecture
AgingAOE-Net is a neural network tailored for multi-omics data, featuring:

Input Layer: Handles high-dimensional omics inputs.
Encoder: Extracts features using convolutional or transformer-based layers.
Fusion Module: Integrates features across omics types.
Prediction Head: Outputs aging-related predictions (e.g., age estimation, classification).
